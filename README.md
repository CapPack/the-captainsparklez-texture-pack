# **CapPack**  

The Official CaptainSparklez Texture Pack, used by CaptainSparklez himself. Plenty of custom textures, splash texts and fun features you won't find anywhere else. Oh, and it reduces rain particles without the need for OptiFine :P. Community inspired and made. The perfect texture pack for any CaptainSparklez fan, loved by all.

## **To Enable Custom Item Names:**  

**Java:** Make sure you enable the texture pack, open *"Options"*, then *"Language"*, and change the language to *"CaptainSparklez (US)"*.

**Bedrock:** Make sure you enable the texture pack, open *"Settings"*, then *"Language"*, and change the language to *"English (CaptainSparklez)"*.
